would it be possible to code a system that used YOLO AI analysis, to narrow down to Animals, and then use another AI to identify just 1 type of aniumal such as hedgehog?

Yes â€” thatâ€™s absolutely possible and actually a **very common and practical design pattern** in modern computer vision systems. Letâ€™s break down how you could architect it.

------

## ðŸ§© System Architecture Overview

### **Step 1: Object Detection with YOLO**

- Use **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** to detect and localize *all animals* in an image or video frame.
- YOLO can detect a wide range of object classes (including animals like dogs, cats, birds, etc.) depending on the model and dataset used (e.g., COCO, custom-trained YOLOv8 model).
- You can filter YOLOâ€™s detections to only those labeled as animals (either directly from YOLOâ€™s class list or via your own mapping).

**Output example from YOLO:**

```
[
  {"class": "cat", "confidence": 0.88, "bbox": [120, 50, 300, 270]},
  {"class": "dog", "confidence": 0.91, "bbox": [400, 100, 580, 310]}
]
```

From this, you could choose to process only the regions that are likely animals.

### **Step 2: Secondary Classifier for Specific Animal**

Once YOLO isolates the animal(s), you crop each detection and pass it to a **secondary AI model** â€” for example, a CNN or ViT trained specifically to recognize one species (like **hedgehogs**).

This second model can:

- Take the cropped image as input.
- Output a binary classification: *hedgehog* vs *not hedgehog*.
- Be much smaller and faster than YOLO since it only focuses on a single species.

**Example pipeline:**

```
for bbox in yolo_detections:
    if bbox["class"] in animal_classes:
        animal_crop = crop_image(frame, bbox)
        is_hedgehog = hedgehog_classifier.predict(animal_crop)
        if is_hedgehog:
            print("Hedgehog detected!")
```

------

### **Step 3: (Optional) Tracking**

If youâ€™re working with **video**, you can integrate an **object tracker** (like DeepSORT or ByteTrack) to maintain consistent IDs for each detected animal, avoiding double-counting.

------

## ðŸ§  Example Stack

- **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics) or **YOLOv9** â€” for real-time detection.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** â€” to train the hedgehog classifier.
- **OpenCV** â€” for image manipulation and cropping.
- **ONNX Runtime** â€” for efficient model inference on edge devices (like Raspberry Pi).

------

## âœ… Advantages of This Modular Approach

- **Efficiency**: YOLO does the heavy lifting; the secondary model is lightweight.
- **Accuracy**: The specialized classifier can be trained on a narrow domain for high precision.
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend to other animals by adding new classifiers.

## ðŸ”§ Example Use Case

Letâ€™s say youâ€™re monitoring wildlife with a camera trap:

1. YOLO identifies all animals in each frame.
2. Cropped images are passed to a hedgehog classifier.
3. If a hedgehog is detected â†’ log it, timestamp it, maybe even trigger a camera flash or notification.

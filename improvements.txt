species detect mode, integrate into main screen.
Move items into Plex folder.
Pictures in the Trained People Window
Videos Tab should play videos.
App Name to link to something?

We Need in-app logging.
Single Frames could be stored for training purposes.
Video Statistics by category could show images and subcategories.
Storage section with delete, could show contents of folder with images and allow multi selection and delete.
Videos section should allow playing. But needs organisation.


Bugs when selecting unknown faces, Select All does not work.
"Last Run" Does not persist
Bug when deleteing from the "Storage" tab, if there is a subfolder such as "Jack_Russell" "✗ Failed to delete: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: 'Jack_Russell'"

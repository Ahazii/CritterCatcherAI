Priority 1 Bug
YOLO categories selection is still not being loaded or maybe not saved?
FAce TRaining - Assigned Multiple faces to a name  - "Failed to load faces" - Did work though, on leaving and reloading tab it is ok.
Widget Does not always load when leaving review and returning.


1:if a video is triggered by movement, eg a car moving in the road,the car that is stationary is being identified. + If an object is identified, what happens if there is more than one object identified?

2:look and feel. Dark Mode +The following tabs open a new page rather than sitting in the home window - YOLO Categories,  CLIP profiles, Review, Model Management, Face TRaining.

3: Logs - do not work

4: Widget - Does not work on the Process Now OR Download All Buttons

5: New Mapping for MediaServer + location per species in that location + Threshold for moving? = Think about this one.

6: Cleanup Downloads + Return Vids to Downloads buttons ???

7: Process now function - keep doing until no videos to download.

8: When Reviewing a video can a reject train the AI - or only for CLIP?

9: Can I train with uploaded data from internet?

10: Static Objects recur over and over - any solution to this?

11: when I select a load of "Person" videos and confirm as person, face detection starts (the widget is working) but the images remain as selected and in the to review tab - remove them so further work can continue at the same time as the face detection runs. + if I leave the tab and re-open the tab they are still there and not seleceted.

12: If confidence in a person detection is above a threshold - automatically pass it for face recognition.

13: Sorting priority - do we need this, what does it do?

14: what happens if a scheduled run occurs when reviewing?

15: explain the folders and storage?

# Detection settings
detection:
  # YOLO model selection: yolov8n (nano - fastest), yolov8s (small), yolov8m (medium), 
  # yolov8l (large), yolov8x (extra large - most accurate)
  yolo_model: yolov8n
  
  # Object labels to detect - MUST match YOLO COCO classes
  # Available COCO classes: person, bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat,
  # traffic light, fire hydrant, stop sign, parking meter, bench, bird, cat, dog, horse, sheep,
  # cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe, backpack, umbrella, handbag, tie, suitcase, frisbee,
  # skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, baseball glove, skateboard, surfboard,
  # tennis racket, bottle, wine glass, cup, fork, knife, spoon, bowl, banana, apple, sandwich,
  # orange, broccoli, carrot, hot dog, pizza, donut, cake, chair, couch, potted plant, bed,
  # dining table, toilet, tv, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone, microwave, oven,
  # toaster, sink, refrigerator, book, clock, vase, scissors, teddy bear, hair drier, toothbrush
  object_labels:
    - bird       # Catches all birds (crows, robins, wrens, finches, etc.)
    - cat        # Includes outdoor/feral cats and potentially small mammals
    - dog        # Dogs and potentially foxes
    - person     # People including delivery persons
    - car
    - bicycle
    - truck      # Delivery trucks
  
  # Confidence threshold for object detection (0.0-1.0)
  # YOLO performs well at 0.25-0.5. Lower = more detections, higher = more accuracy
  confidence_threshold: 0.35
  
  # Number of frames to analyze for object detection (3-20)
  # More frames = more accurate but slower processing
  object_frames: 5
  
  # Face recognition tolerance (0.0-1.0)
  # Lower = more strict matching
  # Higher = more lenient matching
  face_tolerance: 0.6
  
  # Number of frames to analyze for face recognition (5-30)
  # More frames = better chance of recognition but slower
  face_frames: 10
  
  # Face detection model: "hog" (fast, CPU-friendly) or "cnn" (accurate, GPU recommended)

  # "people" = prioritize face recognition over object detection
  # "objects" = prioritize object detection over face recognition
  priority: people
  
  # Discovery mode: automatically find objects not in your tracked list
  # Note: YOLO only detects its 80 COCO classes, but discovery mode will alert you
  # to other COCO objects appearing in videos (e.g., horse, cow, bear, etc.)
